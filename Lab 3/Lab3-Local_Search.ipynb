    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "In this lab session, you will apply your understanding by implementing local search algorithms as discussed in Lectures 4 and 5. We'll explore the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Romanian capital cities as an example.  The TSP is an optimization problem  that seeks the shortest possible route visiting each city exactly once, with the journey starting and ending in the same city, thereby forming a closed loop. TSP has numerous practical applications in logistics, manufacturing, and computer networking. Solving TSP is crucial for optimizing resource utilization and improving efficiency in various industries.\n",

    "In the following, we propose using the Romanian map to address the Traveling Salesman Problem.\n",
    "To do this, we need to build a suitable representation of the problem domain. The choice of representation can significantly affect the performance of search optimization techniques. Since the TSP involves finding a closed loop that visits each city exactly once, we will represent each city as a tuple containing the city name and its position, specified by an (x, y) location on a grid. The _state_ (_Node_) will therefore consist of an ordered sequence (i.e., a list) of cities, with the path defined as the sequence generated by traveling from each city in the list to the next in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculating the distances between every pair of cities on the Romanian map, we will use the Manhattan Distance. The Manhattan distance between two points, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $|x_1-x_2| + |y_1-y_2|$."

    "The TSP is an extremely challenging problem. In computational complexity theory, it is classified as NP-hard, which means there is no known algorithm that can solve all instances of this problem in polynomial time. TSP is considered one of the quintessential examples of a combinatorial optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty of the TSP arises because the number of possible routes grows exponentially as the number of cities increases. Each time a new city is added, the number of potential routes multiplies dramatically. Unlike problems like sorting, which can be efficiently divided into smaller subproblems and solved recursively, the TSP does not lend itself well to such divide-and-conquer approaches due to its complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an instance with **n** cities, there are roughly **(n-1)! / 2** possible routes to evaluate, assuming we treat symmetric routes (i.e., traveling in both directions) as equivalent. This number becomes extremely large even for a modest number of cities. For example, with just **20 cities**, the number of possible routes is around **60 trillion**. This massive search space makes finding the optimal solution computationally impractical for large instances using brute force. This is why heuristic and approximation algorithms, like Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing, are often employed to find good solutions within a reasonable amount of time, even though they may not always guarantee an optimal solution."

    "\n",
    "**Note:** The intuition behind **Hill Climbing** comes from the idea of climbing up the graph of a function to find its peak. In the case of **maximization**, the algorithm takes one step at a time, always moving towards a higher value, in the hope of reaching the highest peak. However, if we start from the shoulder of a suboptimal hill (e.g., the second-highest peak), the algorithm will converge to this **local maximum** and cannot escape to find the global peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **minimization** problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem where we aim to minimize the total distance, the same issue applies in reverse: the algorithm tries to find the lowest point but can get stuck in a **local minimum**, unable to find the best (global) solution. Additionally, Hill Climbing struggles with flat regions of the solution space, where all neighboring states have the same value, making it difficult to make progress towards a global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider an algorithm that can handle these situations more effectively. **Simulated Annealing** is quite similar to Hill Climbing but introduces randomness to help escape local optima. Instead of always picking the best move, it makes random moves. If the random move brings us closer to the global optimum, it is accepted. If not, the algorithm may still accept it based on a probability influenced by the current **\"temperature\"**. When the temperature is high, the algorithm is more likely to accept a bad move, allowing greater exploration. As the temperature decreases, it becomes more selective, usually accepting only better moves, with occasional exceptions. This flexibility allows Simulated Annealing to explore the state space thoroughly, reducing the risk of getting stuck in local optima and helping to find a better overall solution."
